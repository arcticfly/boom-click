# Boom Click chrome extension

This simple JS browser extension allows you to click away annoying browser elements.

## Features

* Hides any element the user clicks while extension is enabled.
* Provides a preview highlight (similar to chrome inspector) of the element that will be removed after clicking.
* Allows user to undo hiding elements. Elements will reappear in reverse order of when they were hidden.

## Commands

After installing and enabling this extension, these commands will be available:

### Enable/Disable Hiding - `Ctrl+B` (`Command+B` on MacOS)
  
  This command allows the user to turn the extension on or off in the active tab, in the same way that clicking the browser extension in the toolbar would.

### Restore most recently hidden item `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (`Command+Shift+Z` on MacOS)
  
  This command allows the user to show the most recently hidden item in the active tab. This can be useful after hiding an important item on accident.
